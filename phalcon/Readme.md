The why, what and how can be found here:    
[Pete Info](https://gist.github.com/ndeet/843cfaedd8be05101b8c#file-pete-info-md)

This is a simple Phalcon (v 2.0.8) app with some Volt templates and a view to display some images.
The goal is to compare the performance of this framework with a similar app using 
Slim Framework and written in Elixir, using Phoenix Framework.
